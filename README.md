# belstart.nvim

Wanted to learn nvim. Figured a good learning project would be to take
kickstart.nvim and modified it using nvim. It has turned into a collection of
kickstart, nvchad, thePrimeagen and random plugins I have come across.

As I am completely new to vim/nvim, I tried to order all of the keymappings to
things that would make sense in my head. Usuaully some sort of mnemonic.

As it has been fun customizing this, it is likely to change frequently and
without warning.
